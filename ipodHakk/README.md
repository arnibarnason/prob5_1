To run the script you need to type:

python3 ipodhack.py "path/to/folder/being/sorted" "path/to/the/folder/containing/the/result"

The resulting folder will contain a folder for all artists containing subfolders (albums by each artist) which then contain the songs of each album.

Songs with no title or album name are given the title/album name: "Untitled".
